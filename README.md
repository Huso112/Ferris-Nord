Hello!
I wanted to make a Nord version of Rust Language.

I inspired from [Nord the wallpapers website](https://nordthemewallpapers.com/All/).

Orange doesn't exactly belong to Nord color palette but I still choosed a close/familiar to it because it's too vivid for the rest of the colors.

I hope you like it ☺️
